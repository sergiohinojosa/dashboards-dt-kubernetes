> ‚ö†Ô∏è In order for the entities to be shown properly, you'll need to add a tag `[Kubernetes]namespace` to your services/pods. This is because the **Performance Engineering Dashboard** only shows transactions monitored in Kubernetes environments, the filter applies here. This will be later OOTB in the product.  See how to [Automatically add the namespace tag to all your containers (pgi) and services](#automatically-add-the-namespace-tag-to-all-your-containers-pgi-and-services)
